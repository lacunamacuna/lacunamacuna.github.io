<h1>Learning To Play a Musical Instrument</h1>

<hr>

<h2>Learning to play an instrument the right way can be one of the most satisfying and exciting ways to spend your free time. With the right dedication and training, you can learn to play any style of sound, any kind of instrument, and start speaking the language of music.</h2>

<div class="repeat-image"></div>

 <br> 
 
<h3>Before we get into the nuts and bolts of the process of learning an instrument, let's take a look at the benefits of learning an instrument:</h3>


<div class="box-view">
<h4>Physical Benefits</h4>

<ul>
<li>Music have been proven more effective in strengthening abstract reasoning skills in younger and older children than does teaching them computers skills.</li>
<br>
<li>Music has been shown to reduce stress, increase productivity, develop creativity, and build confidence.</li>

</ul>

</div>
</div>

<div class="box-view">
<h4>Music on the Brain</h4>

<ul>
<li>Recent discoveries have led scientists to believe that both listening to and playing a musical instrument makes you smarter because these activities actually release more BDNF, CREB, and synapsin I, all elements that strengthen mental capacities.</li>
 <br>
<li>Some of the brain benefits of learning a musical instrument include increased comprehension and math skills, better coordination, and a greater capacity for memory. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="box-view">
<h4>Social Benefits</h4>

<ul>  
<li>The training that the mind and body go through to develop musical comprehension is the same as the training required to develop speech and verbal skills, essential components in any relationship.</li>
 <br>
<li>Music training develops the same muscles that will assist you in cooperation, time-management, organization, and concentration/listening skills.</li>
 <br>
<li>Music training also strengthens a person’s self-expression and helps you to break out of your inhibiting barriers</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="box-view">
<h4>Emotional Benefits</h4>
<ul>
<li>Music has a powerful pull on our emotions, and you don’t need to be a scientist to confirm this as fact.</li>
 <br>
<li>Regularly playing an instrument teaches you perseverance, discipline, and responsibility, important skills for accomplishing anything in life.</li>
 <br>
<li>There is an undeniable stress-relieving power of playing your own song.</li>

</ul>

<h3>Learning to play an instrument is easier said than done. There are many things you should before you begin your journey. Below I've listed 5 that I consider the most crucial.</h3>

<ol>

<li>You will not be able to play perfectly immediately.</li>
<br>
<li>Everyone will expect you to be able to play perfectly immediately.</li>
<br>
<li>Your practising will sound terrible at first.</li>
<br>
<li>It's easy to give up if you don't have the dedication.</li>
<br>
<li>The last and most important thing is <i>practice, practice, practice.</i></li>

<br>
<br>

</ol>
<h4>Needless to say, there are hundreds if not thousands of different varieties of instruments out there. They are often classified into "families" based on how they are played, the kind of sound it makes, and the actual material the instrument is made from.

<h3>As you can see, there are countless options of what instrument you can learn. I will present the three most popular instruments below. Under each instrument explanation, there is a sample audio of the respective instrument.</h3>

<br>

<h3>Piano</h3> 

<img src="http://www.pianolessonstime.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/piano-021.jpg" width="250" height="150" alt="No image found">

<h4>It might surprise you to know that 21 million Americans play the piano! The piano is possibly the most versatile of all instruments because it is played in almost every genre and can be accompanied or played solo. It will take patience and determination to play well, but once you master it, you may have a good chance at pursuing a career!</h4>

<h3>Guitar</h3>

<img src="http://www.takamine.com/templates/default/images/g70.png" width="300" height="100" alt="No image found">

<h4>The guitar comes in at a close second because of its own versatility, cost, and the fact that it can be accompanied or played solo. While the piano has been popular for generations, the rise of rock and pop music have attributed to the popularity of the guitar. You can play acoustic, electric, or bass guitar.</h4>

<h4>The violin comes in at third on our list. While it is played a lot in classical music, it is an important part of several genres. It is fairly easy to learn and you can purchase different sizes, which makes this a great instrument for kids to start out with.</h4>
